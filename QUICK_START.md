# Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with Discogs Manager CLI in under 5 minutes.

---

## What You'll Need

- [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/) installed
- A [Discogs account](https://www.discogs.com) (free)
- 5 minutes of your time

---

## Step 1: Install

Clone and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/discogs-manager.git
cd discogs-manager
npm install
```

---

## Step 2: Get Your Discogs API Token

1. Go to [discogs.com/settings/developers](https://www.discogs.com/settings/developers)
2. Click **"Generate new token"**
3. Copy the token (you'll need it in the next step)

---

## Step 3: Configure

Create your configuration file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your credentials:

```env
DISCOGS_API_TOKEN=paste_your_token_here
DISCOGS_USERNAME=your_discogs_username

# Generate encryption key (required)
ENCRYPTION_KEY=run_this_command_below_and_paste_result_here
```

Generate your encryption key:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Copy the output and paste it as your `ENCRYPTION_KEY` in `.env`.

**Your `.env` should look like this:**
```env
DISCOGS_API_TOKEN=AbCdEf123456789XyZ
DISCOGS_USERNAME=musiclover42
ENCRYPTION_KEY=a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6e7f8a9b0c1d2e3f4a5b6c7d8e9f0a1b2
```

---

## Step 4: Sync Your Collection

This downloads your entire Discogs collection to a local database:

```bash
npm run dev -- sync
```

**What to expect:**
- Takes 1-3 minutes for a typical collection (50-200 releases)
- Shows real-time progress
- Automatically handles API rate limits
- Stores everything locally in `data/discogs-manager.db`

**Example output:**
```
✔ Syncing releases [████████████████████] 100% | 127/127 releases
✔ Successfully synced 127 releases
```

---

## Step 5: Explore Your Collection

### View Statistics

```bash
npm run dev -- stats
```

**Example output:**
```
Collection Statistics for musiclover42
─────────────────────────────────────
Total Releases: 127
Total Genres: 15
Year Range: 1967 - 2024

Top Genres:
  • Rock: 45 releases
  • Electronic: 28 releases
  • Jazz: 18 releases
  • Hip Hop: 12 releases
  • Soul: 10 releases
```

### Browse Your Releases

```bash
npm run dev -- list
```

Shows a table of all your releases with titles, artists, years, and genres.

### Filter by Genre

```bash
npm run dev -- list --genres "Rock"
```

### Filter by Year Range

```bash
npm run dev -- list --min-year 1970 --max-year 1979
```

### Combine Filters

```bash
npm run dev -- list --genres "Jazz" --min-year 2000 --min-rating 4
```

---

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Find Your 80s Rock Albums

```bash
npm run dev -- list --genres "Rock" --min-year 1980 --max-year 1989
```

### Workflow 2: See Your Highest Rated Releases

```bash
npm run dev -- list --min-rating 4
```

### Workflow 3: Update Your Collection

Run this periodically to add new releases you've added to Discogs:

```bash
npm run dev -- sync
```

It only syncs new releases (skips existing ones), so it's fast!

### Workflow 4: Force Refresh Everything

If you've updated ratings or metadata on Discogs:

```bash
npm run dev -- sync --force
```

This re-downloads all release data (slower but updates everything).

---

## Optional: SoundCloud Playlists

Want to create SoundCloud playlists from your collection? Follow these extra steps.

### 1. Create a SoundCloud App

1. Go to [soundcloud.com/you/apps](https://soundcloud.com/you/apps)
2. Click **"Register a new app"**
3. Fill in:
   - **App name**: "Discogs Manager"
   - **App website**: Your GitHub repo URL or any URL
4. Copy your **Client ID**

### 2. Add to .env

```env
SOUNDCLOUD_CLIENT_ID=paste_your_client_id_here
```

### 3. Authenticate

```bash
npm run dev -- auth
```

This opens your browser to authorize the app. Click "Connect" and you're done!

### 4. Create a Playlist

```bash
npm run dev -- playlist --title "80s Rock Classics" --genres "Rock" --min-year 1980 --max-year 1989
```

**What happens:**
1. Filters your collection by the criteria (Rock, 1980-1989)
2. Searches SoundCloud for each release
3. Creates a playlist with all found tracks
4. Returns the playlist URL

**Example output:**
```
✔ Created playlist: https://soundcloud.com/you/sets/80s-rock-classics
✔ Added 34 tracks from 42 releases
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Error: DISCOGS_API_TOKEN is required"

You didn't set up your `.env` file. Go back to **Step 3**.

### "Rate limit exceeded"

The CLI handles this automatically. You'll see:
```
⚠ Rate limit nearly exhausted. Pausing for 60 seconds...
```

Just wait—it will resume automatically.

### "No releases found"

You need to sync first:
```bash
npm run dev -- sync
```

### "Failed to fetch release"

Some releases may fail temporarily. They're automatically queued for retry:
```bash
npm run dev -- retry
```

### Database is locked

Wait for the current operation to finish. Only one operation can run at a time.
