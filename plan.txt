# Discogs Manager CLI - Development Plan

## Project Overview
A command-line interface for managing Discogs music collections and creating SoundCloud playlists from collection subsets.

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Project scaffolding with TypeScript/Node.js
- [x] Project structure setup (src/, tests/, .github/)
- [x] Configuration files (tsconfig.json, jest.config.js, .eslintrc.json, .prettierrc)
- [x] API client implementations
  - [x] Discogs API client wrapper
  - [x] SoundCloud API client wrapper
- [x] Database service using SQLite3
  - [x] Schema initialization
  - [x] CRUD operations for releases and playlists
- [x] Service layer
  - [x] CollectionService for filtering and organizing releases
  - [x] PlaylistService for creating SoundCloud playlists
- [x] CLI commands
  - [x] sync - Sync Discogs collection
  - [x] list - Display releases with filters
  - [x] stats - Show collection statistics
  - [x] playlist - Create SoundCloud playlists from subsets
- [x] Utility functions and formatters
- [x] Environment configuration (.env.example)
- [x] Build system setup with TypeScript compilation
- [x] Package dependencies configured and installed
- [x] Project compilation successful
- [x] Git repository initialized and committed
- [x] Feature branch created (feature/test-suite)
- [x] Test suite implementation (tests/)
  - [x] CollectionService tests (15 tests passing)
  - [x] API client tests (all tests passing)
  - [x] DatabaseManager tests (9 tests passing)
- [x] Database initialization fix (db.serialize() for synchronous table creation)
- [x] Test timestamp handling (proper Date to ISO string conversion)
- [x] All 24 tests passing with 10s timeout

## Remaining Tasks
- [ ] Command handler tests (sync, list, stats, playlist commands)
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Error handling and edge case management
- [ ] API error handling improvements
- [ ] Database migration system
- [ ] Additional filtering options (ratings, styles)
- [ ] Batch operations optimization
- [ ] Documentation improvements
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup
- [ ] Merge feature/test-suite to main

## Key Technologies
- TypeScript 4.9.5+
- Node.js 25.6.1+
- Commander.js for CLI
- Axios for HTTP requests
- SQLite3 for local storage
- Jest for testing
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality

## Architecture
- API Layer: Direct wrappers for external APIs
- Service Layer: Business logic and data processing
- Database Layer: SQLite3 persistence
- CLI Layer: Commander.js command handlers
- Type System: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces

## Build Status
✅ Project compiles without errors
✅ Dependencies installed successfully
✅ Database schema created
✅ CLI commands defined
✅ All 24 tests passing (collection, api, database)
✅ Database initialization working reliably
✅ Ready for command tests and feature branch merge

## Latest Session Progress (Feb 16, 2026)
- Fixed database initialization with db.serialize() for synchronous table creation
- Converted DatabaseManager to return initialization Promise
- Fixed timestamp handling: Date objects properly converted to ISO strings
- All database tests now passing reliably (9 tests)
- Collection and API tests verified passing (15 tests total)
- Committed to feature/test-suite branch with all fixes
- Test suite now ready for next phase: command handler tests
