# Discogs Manager CLI - Development Plan

## Project Overview
A command-line interface for managing Discogs music collections and creating SoundCloud playlists from collection subsets.

## Critical Issue: SoundCloud API Integration Needs Fixes
The playlist creation feature is failing due to API mismatches with SoundCloud documentation.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Wrong Endpoint for Playlist Creation**
   - Current: `POST /me/playlists`
   - Should be: `POST /playlists`
   
2. **Incorrect Request Body Structure**
   - Current: Direct `{tracks: [...]}` 
   - Should be: Wrapped in `{playlist: {tracks: [...]}}`
   - Affects both create and add operations

3. **Inefficient Flow**
   - Creates empty playlist first, then adds tracks one-by-one
   - Should include all tracks in initial creation request
   - This reduces API calls significantly

4. **Missing Response Validation**
   - Playlist response not validated for required fields
   - Error "Invalid playlist ID: must be a non-empty string" suggests id extraction is failing

### Reference: SoundCloud API Docs
**Create Playlist:**
```
POST /playlists
-d "{'playlist': {'title':'YOUR_TITLE', 'sharing':'public', 'tracks':[{'id':1},{'id':2}]}}"
```

**Add Tracks:**
```
PUT /playlists/PLAYLIST_ID
-d "{'playlist': {'tracks':[{'id':1}, {'id':2}]}}"
```

## Fix Implementation Plan (ACTIVE BRANCH: fix/soundcloud-api)

### Phase 1: Fix Core API Issues
- [ ] Update `createPlaylist()` endpoint from `/me/playlists` to `/playlists`
- [ ] Wrap request body in `playlist` object wrapper
- [ ] Fix `addTrackToPlaylist()` to wrap tracks in `playlist` object
- [ ] Add response validation and better error logging
- [ ] Create `createPlaylistWithTracks()` method for batch creation

### Phase 2: Optimize Playlist Service
- [ ] Modify `PlaylistService.createPlaylist()` to collect all tracks first
- [ ] Use new batch method to create playlist with all tracks in one call
- [ ] Reduce total API calls from (1 create + N adds) to (1 create + N searches)

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Build with `npm run build`
- [ ] Test auth with `npm run dev -- auth` (verify token is valid)
- [ ] Test playlist with `npm run dev -- playlist --title "Test Jazz" --genres "Jazz"`

## Completed Tasks (Previous Sessions)
- [x] Full TypeScript/Node.js CLI implementation with all 5 commands (sync, list, stats, retry, playlist)
- [x] Discogs API integration with pagination support (handles collections 50+ items)
- [x] SQLite database with better-sqlite3 (synchronous, WAL-enabled, reliable)
- [x] Service layer: CollectionService, PlaylistService, DatabaseManager
- [x] Advanced filtering: genres, styles, year range, rating range
- [x] Comprehensive error handling: retry queue + dead letter queue for failed releases
- [x] Local rate limit throttling (proactive, no 429 errors)
- [x] Database optimization: skip existing releases unless --force flag
- [x] Progress feedback with ora spinners across all commands
- [x] Full test suite: 93 tests passing (100% pass rate)
- [x] Clean CLI lifecycle: proper process exit handling
- [x] SoundCloud OAuth 2.1 with PKCE implementation
- [x] Auth command with browser-based flow
- [x] Improved auth command error handling and process finalization

## Build Status
✅ Project compiles without errors (awaiting SoundCloud API fixes)
✅ All 93 tests passing (100% pass rate)
✅ OAuth 2.1 authentication working
⚠️ Playlist creation failing due to API mismatches

## Session History
- **Session 6**: Migrated sqlite3 → better-sqlite3, implemented Discogs pagination
- **Session 8**: Added error handling (retry queue + DLQ), local rate limit throttling, database skip-existing optimization
- **Session 9**: Merged feature/make-retries-work to master
- **Session 10**: Implemented list command comprehensive filtering (genres, styles, year range, rating range), updated documentation
- **Session 11**: Enhanced stats command with genre/style breakdown by count, added --verbose flag
- **Session 14**: Completed SoundCloud rate limit implementation, merged to master
- **Session 15**: Implemented OAuth 2.1 with PKCE, improved auth command, merged to master
- **Current**: Fixing SoundCloud API endpoint mismatches (branch: fix/soundcloud-api)
   - Calls throttleIfApproachingLimit() in playlist creation loop
   - Throws descriptive error if limit exceeded

✅ **Step 5: Update playlist command with rate limit feedback**
   - Added SoundCloudRateLimitService import to playlist command
   - Creates rate limit service with database
   - Initializes from database on startup (restore previous state)
   - Passes service to PlaylistService
   - Enhanced error handling for rate limit errors with descriptive messages

✅ **Step 6: Store rate limit state in database**
   - Added soundcloud_rate_limit table to database schema
   - Fields: id (primary), remaining, resetTime, maxRequests, lastUpdated
   - Implemented saveRateLimitState() method in DatabaseManager
   - Implemented getRateLimitState() method to restore on startup
   - SoundCloudRateLimitService now persists state after each API response
   - Automatically restores previous state via initializeFromDatabase()

✅ **Step 7: Add comprehensive rate limit error tests**
   - Added 8 new test cases to error-handling.test.ts
   - Tests cover: error parsing, zero requests, approaching limit, exceeded limit, time calculations, formatting
   - All tests passing with 125 total tests (97 existing + 28 new for rate limiting)
   - No regressions in other functionality

✅ **Step 8: Update README documentation**
   - Enhanced "Rate Limiting" section with both Discogs and SoundCloud info
   - Explains SoundCloud 15,000 per 24-hour limit
   - Added automatic throttling behavior explanation
   - Shows example log messages
   - Updated troubleshooting section with SoundCloud rate limit guidance
   - Added soundcloud_rate_limit table to database documentation

✅ **Step 9: Final test verification**
   - Confirmed all 125 tests passing (100% pass rate)
   - No regressions in existing functionality
   - TypeScript compiles cleanly

✅ **Step 10: Commit all changes**

### Implementation Summary

The SoundCloud rate limit handling is now fully production-ready:

**Architecture:**
- **SoundCloudRateLimitService**: Manages rate limit state with database persistence
- **SoundCloudRateLimitError**: Custom error class for 429 responses
- **Throttling Logic**: Automatic pause when approaching limit, resume after reset
- **Database Persistence**: Stores/restores rate limit state across CLI runs
- **Command Integration**: Playlist command creates and initializes rate limit service

**Features:**
- Prevents 429 errors through proactive throttling
- 15,000 requests per 24-hour window
- Automatic pause and resume without user intervention
- Detailed logging with human-readable wait times
- Reset time tracking and persistence
- Comprehensive test coverage (20 rate limit tests + 8 error tests)

**Test Coverage:**
- 125 total tests passing (97 existing + 28 new)
