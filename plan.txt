# Discogs Manager CLI - Development Plan

## Project Overview
A command-line interface for managing Discogs music collections and creating SoundCloud playlists from collection subsets.

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Full TypeScript/Node.js CLI implementation with all 5 commands (sync, list, stats, retry, playlist)
- [x] Discogs API integration with pagination support (handles collections 50+ items)
- [x] SQLite database with better-sqlite3 (synchronous, WAL-enabled, reliable)
- [x] Service layer: CollectionService, PlaylistService, DatabaseManager
- [x] Advanced filtering: genres, styles, year range, rating range
- [x] Comprehensive error handling: retry queue + dead letter queue for failed releases
- [x] Local rate limit throttling (proactive, no 429 errors)
- [x] Database optimization: skip existing releases unless --force flag
- [x] Progress feedback with ora spinners across all commands
- [x] Full test suite: 93 tests passing (100% pass rate)
- [x] Clean CLI lifecycle: proper process exit handling
- [x] Complete documentation: README, CONTRIBUTING, API_REFERENCE
