# Discogs Manager CLI - Development Plan

## Project Overview
A command-line interface for managing Discogs music collections and creating SoundCloud playlists from collection subsets.

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Full TypeScript/Node.js CLI implementation with all 5 commands (sync, list, stats, retry, playlist)
- [x] Discogs API integration with pagination support (handles collections 50+ items)
- [x] SQLite database with better-sqlite3 (synchronous, WAL-enabled, reliable)
- [x] Service layer: CollectionService, PlaylistService, DatabaseManager
- [x] Advanced filtering: genres, styles, year range, rating range
- [x] Comprehensive error handling: retry queue + dead letter queue for failed releases
- [x] Local rate limit throttling (proactive, no 429 errors)
- [x] Database optimization: skip existing releases unless --force flag
- [x] Progress feedback with ora spinners across all commands
- [x] Full test suite: 93 tests passing (100% pass rate)
- [x] Clean CLI lifecycle: proper process exit handling
- [x] Complete documentation: README, CONTRIBUTING, API_REFERENCE

## Build Status
✅ Project compiles without errors
✅ All 93 tests passing (100% pass rate)
✅ Ready for production with robust error handling and rate limiting

## Session History
- **Session 6**: Migrated sqlite3 → better-sqlite3, implemented Discogs pagination
- **Session 8**: Added error handling (retry queue + DLQ), local rate limit throttling, database skip-existing optimization
- **Session 9**: Merged feature/make-retries-work to master
- **Session 10**: Implemented list command comprehensive filtering (genres, styles, year range, rating range), updated documentation
- **Session 11**: Enhanced stats command with genre/style breakdown by count, added --verbose flag

## Current Session (Session 14) - In Progress: Complete SoundCloud Rate Limit Implementation

### Goal
Complete and merge the SoundCloud API rate limit handling implementation to master.

### Progress Summary (Session 14)

**All Steps Completed and Merged to Master! ✅**

✅ **Step 3: Implement throttling strategy**
   - Added throttleIfApproachingLimit() async method to SoundCloudAPIClient
   - Checks for exceeded limit and throws error if remaining ≤ 0
   - Pauses execution when approaching limit (≤5 remaining)
   - Logs warning with human-readable wait time
   - Resumes automatically after reset_time

✅ **Step 4: Update PlaylistService with rate limit awareness**
   - Injected SoundCloudRateLimitService into PlaylistService constructor
   - Pre-checks rate limit before creating playlist
   - Calls throttleIfApproachingLimit() in playlist creation loop
   - Throws descriptive error if limit exceeded

✅ **Step 5: Update playlist command with rate limit feedback**
   - Added SoundCloudRateLimitService import to playlist command
   - Creates rate limit service with database
   - Initializes from database on startup (restore previous state)
   - Passes service to PlaylistService
   - Enhanced error handling for rate limit errors with descriptive messages

✅ **Step 6: Store rate limit state in database**
   - Added soundcloud_rate_limit table to database schema
   - Fields: id (primary), remaining, resetTime, maxRequests, lastUpdated
   - Implemented saveRateLimitState() method in DatabaseManager
   - Implemented getRateLimitState() method to restore on startup
   - SoundCloudRateLimitService now persists state after each API response
   - Automatically restores previous state via initializeFromDatabase()

✅ **Step 7: Add comprehensive rate limit error tests**
   - Added 8 new test cases to error-handling.test.ts
   - Tests cover: error parsing, zero requests, approaching limit, exceeded limit, time calculations, formatting
   - All tests passing with 125 total tests (97 existing + 28 new for rate limiting)
   - No regressions in other functionality

✅ **Step 8: Update README documentation**
   - Enhanced "Rate Limiting" section with both Discogs and SoundCloud info
   - Explains SoundCloud 15,000 per 24-hour limit
   - Added automatic throttling behavior explanation
   - Shows example log messages
   - Updated troubleshooting section with SoundCloud rate limit guidance
   - Added soundcloud_rate_limit table to database documentation

✅ **Step 9: Final test verification**
   - Confirmed all 125 tests passing (100% pass rate)
   - No regressions in existing functionality
   - TypeScript compiles cleanly

✅ **Step 10: Commit all changes**
   - 6 commits to feature/soundcloud-rate-limiting branch:
     - Step 3: Throttling strategy
     - Step 5: Playlist command feedback
     - Step 6: Database persistence
     - Step 7: Error tests
     - Step 8: README documentation
   - All commits on feature branch

✅ **Step 11: Merge to master**
   - Fast-forward merged feature/soundcloud-rate-limiting to master
   - 9 files changed: +769 lines, -141 lines
   - New files: soundcloud-rate-limit.ts (182 lines), soundcloud-rate-limit.test.ts (163 lines)
   - Updated: soundcloud.ts, playlist.ts, database.ts, error-handling.test.ts, README.md, plan.txt
   - Final verification: 125 tests passing, clean build on master

### Implementation Summary

The SoundCloud rate limit handling is now fully production-ready:

**Architecture:**
- **SoundCloudRateLimitService**: Manages rate limit state with database persistence
- **SoundCloudRateLimitError**: Custom error class for 429 responses
- **Throttling Logic**: Automatic pause when approaching limit, resume after reset
- **Database Persistence**: Stores/restores rate limit state across CLI runs
- **Command Integration**: Playlist command creates and initializes rate limit service

**Features:**
- Prevents 429 errors through proactive throttling
- 15,000 requests per 24-hour window
- Automatic pause and resume without user intervention
- Detailed logging with human-readable wait times
- Reset time tracking and persistence
- Comprehensive test coverage (20 rate limit tests + 8 error tests)

**Test Coverage:**
- 125 total tests passing (97 existing + 28 new)
- SoundCloudRateLimitService: 20 unit tests
- Error handling: 8 rate limit error tests
- 100% pass rate with no regressions

**Documentation:**
- README explains both Discogs and SoundCloud throttling
- Troubleshooting section covers 24-hour reset guidance
- Database documentation includes soundcloud_rate_limit table

### Branch Status
- **Master:** Ready for production with all 11 steps completed and merged
- **Feature branch:** feature/soundcloud-rate-limiting merged (can be deleted)

### Ready for Next Session
The project is now ready for:
1. Additional features or enhancements
2. Bug fixes or edge case handling
3. Performance optimizations
4. User testing and feedback

## Session 11 - Completed: Enhance Stats Command

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED and merged to master
- Enhanced stats command with genre/style breakdown by count
- CollectionService updated with getGenreStats() and getStyleStats()
- Stats command displays top genres with release counts
- Added --verbose flag for detailed style breakdown
- All tests passing (93+ tests)
- Merged feature/stats-command-enhancement to master
