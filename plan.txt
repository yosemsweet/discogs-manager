- [x] API client implementations
  - [x] Discogs API client wrapper
  - [x] SoundCloud API client wrapper
- [x] Database service using SQLite3
  - [x] Schema initialization
  - [x] CRUD operations for releases and playlists
- [x] Service layer
  - [x] CollectionService for filtering and organizing releases
  - [x] PlaylistService for creating SoundCloud playlists
- [x] CLI commands
  - [x] sync - Sync Discogs collection
