## Remaining Tasks
- [ ] Switch to better-sqlite3 for improved performance and stability
  - [ ] Replace sqlite3 with better-sqlite3 package
  - [ ] Refactor DatabaseManager to use better-sqlite3 synchronous API
  - [ ] Implement proper statement preparation and cleanup
  - [ ] Add explicit connection close handling
  - [ ] Update all database tests for new implementation
  - [ ] Verify NAPI crash is resolved with better-sqlite3
  - [ ] Performance benchmarking vs sqlite3
- [ ] Handle Discogs collections with more than 50 items
  - [ ] Implement pagination support in DiscogsAPIClient.getCollection()
  - [ ] Update CollectionService.syncCollection() to handle pagination
  - [ ] Track total pages and accumulate results
  - [ ] Add progress indicator for multi-page syncs
  - [ ] Test with collections > 50 items
  - [ ] Update sync command to display page progress
- [ ] Documentation improvements (README enhancements)
- [ ] Database migration system
- [ ] Additional filtering options (ratings, styles)
- [ ] Batch operations optimization
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup

## Key Technologies
- TypeScript 4.9.5+
- Node.js 25.6.1+
- Commander.js for CLI
- Axios for HTTP requests
- SQLite3 for local storage
- Jest for testing
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality

## Architecture
- API Layer: Direct wrappers for external APIs
- Service Layer: Business logic and data processing
- Database Layer: SQLite3 persistence
- CLI Layer: Commander.js command handlers
- Type System: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces

## Build Status
✅ Project compiles without errors
✅ Dependencies installed successfully
✅ Database schema created with proper initialization
✅ CLI commands defined with input validation
✅ All 93 tests passing (15+9+9+29+26+14 - collection, api, database, commands, error-handling, integration)
✅ Database initialization working reliably
✅ Jest ES module handling configured
✅ Comprehensive error handling implemented
✅ Input validation for all API methods
✅ HTTP timeout and status code handling
✅ Integration tests covering end-to-end workflows
✅ Ready for documentation and final refinements

## Latest Session Progress (Feb 16, 2026 - Session 3)
- Created comprehensive error handling tests (26 tests)
  - API error handling for all HTTP status codes
  - Input validation edge cases
  - Database edge cases (duplicates, empty results, special chars)
  - Concurrent operations
  - Resource management
- Implemented custom error classes:
  - DiscogsAPIClientError with status codes
  - SoundCloudAPIClientError with status codes
- Enhanced API clients with:
  - Input validation for all methods
  - HTTP timeout configuration (30s)
  - Status code handling (401, 404, 429, 500+)
  - Detailed error messages for debugging
  - Network error detection
- All 79 tests passing (15+9+9+29+26)
- Made DatabaseManager.initialized public for testing

## Latest Session Progress (Feb 16, 2026 - Session 4)
- Created comprehensive integration tests (14 new tests)
  - Complete Collection Workflow:
    - Collection sync and statistics
    - Multi-criteria filtering (genre, year range, combined)
    - Genre extraction and analysis
  - Playlist Creation Workflow:
    - Create playlist from filtered releases
    - Track playlist releases in database
    - Handle empty playlist scenarios
  - Multi-Step Workflows:
    - Sync → Filter → Create Playlist
    - Complex filtering with statistics
    - Rapid successive operations and parallelization
  - Error Recovery Workflows:
    - API failure and retry with fallback
    - Continue processing after individual record errors
    - Database lock handling and concurrent reads
  - Data Integrity Workflows:
    - Consistency through multiple operations
    - Data preservation through service operations
- All 93 tests passing (79 existing + 14 new integration tests)
- Merged feature/integration-tests branch to master
- Updated plan.txt with completion status
- Feature/error-handling branch ready for merge

## Latest Session Progress (Feb 16, 2026 - Session 5)
- Fixed SQLite3 native module NAPI crash with Node.js 25
  - Added process.exit(0) after successful command completion
  - Updated all CLI commands (sync, list, stats, playlist) to exit cleanly
  - Prevents NAPI crash during database connection cleanup
  - Removes problematic process event handlers
- Successfully synced Discogs collection (50 releases)
  - Verified database contains synced releases with metadata
  - Tested list command with genre filtering
  - Tested stats command showing collection overview
- Identified next priority: better-sqlite3 migration for improved stability
- Identified need: Pagination support for collections > 50 items
- All 93 tests still passing after NAPI fix
